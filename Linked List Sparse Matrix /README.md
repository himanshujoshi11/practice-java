# A Linked List Sparse Matrix Implementation

## About
A typical linked list implementation of a sparse matrix relies on two sets of interconnected linked lists: one for the rows of the matrix, and one for the columns of the matrix. On both sides, an array can be used to keep track of the heads of each linked list, and each element is part of one column linked list as well as one row linked list.
